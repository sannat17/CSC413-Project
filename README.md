# CSC413-Project
Motivated by the importance of safety in today's AI systems that control a lot of our lives, my group decided to conduct our independent research project for CSC413's coursework (Neural Networks and Deep Learning) to better understand how these systems work. To that end, we investigated the inner workings of Graph Neural Networks to understand what, and how, they learn from data.

The code in this repository was used to support our research project on:
[What Do Graph Convolutional Neural Networks Learn?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01839)
